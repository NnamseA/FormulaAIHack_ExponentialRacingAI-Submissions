Technical submission:
Application of Low-Code Machine Learning Models to provided dataset for the 2022 #FormulaAIHack

22/02/2022


Team: Nnamse Akpan, Qasid Ali , Danielle Alice Desanges Aucéane THIAM MÉKÀ de GOGUENHEIM

Task: Our aim was to see if we could replicate Challenge 1: Data Analytics during the #FormulaAIHack on a low code environment. We succeeded in obtaining, cleaning the dataset and successfully applying chosen Oracle Machine Learning Models to said dataset to achieve the highest possible confidence and accuracy. 

1.	Data Sources:
Game play 
Real world applications:
Simulations
IoTs
Weather stream

2.	Method of Operation :
Dataset > EDA>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure> Oracle Analytics Cloud >Trained Model> Prediction> Prescriptive Analysis

Dataset: from data provided at https://github.com/oracle-devrel/formula-ai-2022-hackathon/blob/main/challenges/challenge1.md weather.csv
 
Autonomous Data Warehouse
Preliminary data cleanup
Further Data cleanup on OAC Dataset
 

Models used: 
Random Forest Multi-Classification targeted at column M_RAIN_PERCENTAGE    

88% Accuracy

Linear Regression Machine Learning Model targeted at column M_WEATHER  96% Accuracy 

100% Accuracy (Overfitting)
